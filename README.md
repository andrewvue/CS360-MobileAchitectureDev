# CS360-MobileAchitectureDev
Course Description Students will apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards. Upon completion of a fully-functional mobile application, students will conduct security, product assuredness, and compatibility checks before launching the application.


Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The user need that this app was designed to address was a way to track their weight by allowing them to input their weight data periodically. This could be daily, weekly or monthly.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The neccessary screens and features were a login feature and a screen that intakes and displays their weight entries. The design of my UI was to be a simple as possible to allow and encrouage usage from all users regardless of how tech savvy they are. This means a simple design without many screens and scrolling.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach I took in this process were finely guided throughout the course, but planning was a big part of it. Creating a rough design of the UI I wanted helped me put vision to my ideas and gave me a template to create my applicaiton. I think this technique of creating a template and visual aids will help me in the future especially in the areas such as "front end" or "UI/UX" development. I found that drawing out my ideas helped my thought process so I believe this will be helpful for "back end" development as well.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The tests I did were to have a friend use my app. As a developer I would most likely be bias and I know how my app "should work" and "should be used". Unlike me a user would find out as they go and this process was important because it revealed certain flaws and weaknesses of my applciation. Through this I decided to remove certain fluff and uneccessary features that would cause the app to crash or break. Keeping the app simple and functional and then building from there is my plan.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I don't think there was anything in particular that I had to innovate, but the main challenge was that my computer is running an AMD CPU and android studios doesn't play well with my set up. Being able to get Android Studios to run only some of the time while spending most of my time troubleshooting my set up and envrionment as opposed to actually developing was detrimental to my process. In the end I decided to purchase a Macbook due to deadlines and the frsutration of re-configuring my setup each time I open Android Studios. (thank goodness for black friday deals)

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the component from my mobile app I was successful in demonstration my knowledge is the UI design. I think tha the ease of use design helps to compensate for other areas that I lack in such as additional features.
